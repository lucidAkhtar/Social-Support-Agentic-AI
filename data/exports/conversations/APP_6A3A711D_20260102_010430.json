      "assistant_response": "To increase your approved support amount, there are several factors to consider based on the information provided in your application (APP_6A3A711D). Here's a breakdown of the current situation and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Monthly Income: Your monthly income is 4210.06 AED, which is below the threshold indicating a financial need.
